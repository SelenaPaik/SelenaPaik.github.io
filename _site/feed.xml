<h1 id="h1-header">H1 Header</h1>

<p>Paragraphs are separated by a blank line.</p>

<p>2nd paragraph. <em>Italic</em>, <strong>bold</strong>, and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">monospace</code>. Itemized lists
look like:</p>

<ul>
  <li>this one</li>
  <li>that one</li>
  <li>the other one</li>
</ul>

<p>Note that — not considering the asterisk — the actual text
content starts at 4-columns in.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Block quotes are
written like so.</p>

  <p>They can span multiple paragraphs,
if you like.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Use 3 dashes for an em-dash. Use 2 dashes for ranges (ex., “it’s all
in chapters 12–14”). Three dots … will be converted to an ellipsis.
Unicode is supported. ☺</p>

<h2 id="h2-header">H2 Header</h2>

<p>Here’s a numbered list:</p>

<ol>
  <li>first item</li>
  <li>second item</li>
  <li>third item</li>
</ol>

<p>Note again how the actual text starts at 4 columns in (4 characters
from the left side). Here’s a code sample:</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code># Let me re-iterate ...
for i in 1 .. 10 { do-something(i) }
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>As you probably guessed, indented 4 spaces. By the way, instead of
indenting the block, you can use delimited blocks, if you like:</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>define foobar() {
    print "Welcome to flavor country!";
}
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>(which makes copying &amp; pasting easier). You can optionally mark the
delimited block for Pandoc to syntax highlight it:</p>

<div class="language-python highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="kn">import</span> <span class="nn">time</span>
<span class="c1"># Quick, count to ten!
</span><span class="k">for</span> <span class="n">i</span> <span class="ow">in</span> <span class="nb">range</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="mi">10</span><span class="p">):</span>
    <span class="c1"># (but not *too* quick)
</span>    <span class="n">time</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="n">sleep</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="mf">0.5</span><span class="p">)</span>
    <span class="k">print</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">i</span><span class="p">)</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<h3 id="an-h3-header">An h3 header</h3>

<p>Now a nested list:</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>First, get these ingredients:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>carrots</li>
      <li>celery</li>
      <li>lentils</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Boil some water.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Dump everything in the pot and follow
this algorithm:</p>

    <div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>find wooden spoon
uncover pot
stir
cover pot
balance wooden spoon precariously on pot handle
wait 10 minutes
goto first step (or shut off burner when done)
</code></pre></div>    </div>

    <p>Do not bump wooden spoon or it will fall.</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>Notice again how text always lines up on 4-space indents (including
that last line which continues item 3 above).</p>

<p>Here’s a link to <a href="http://foo.bar">a website</a>, to a <a href="local-doc.html">local
doc</a>, and to a <a href="#an-h2-header">section heading in the current
doc</a>. Here’s a footnote <sup id="fnref:1" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote" rel="footnote">1</a></sup>.</p>

<p>Tables can look like this:</p>

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th style="text-align: center">Header 1</th>
      <th style="text-align: center">Header 2</th>
      <th style="text-align: center">Header 3</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td style="text-align: center">data1a</td>
      <td style="text-align: center">Data is longer than header</td>
      <td style="text-align: center">1</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td style="text-align: center">d1b</td>
      <td style="text-align: center">add a cell</td>
      <td style="text-align: center"> </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td style="text-align: center">lorem</td>
      <td style="text-align: center">ipsum</td>
      <td style="text-align: center">3</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td style="text-align: center"> </td>
      <td style="text-align: center">empty outside cells</td>
      <td style="text-align: center"> </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td style="text-align: center">skip</td>
      <td style="text-align: center"> </td>
      <td style="text-align: center">5</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td style="text-align: center">six</td>
      <td style="text-align: center">Morbi purus</td>
      <td style="text-align: center">6</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<p>A horizontal rule follows.</p>

<hr />

<p>Here’s a definition list:</p>

<dl>
  <dt>apples</dt>
  <dd>Good for making applesauce.</dd>
  <dt>oranges</dt>
  <dd>Citrus!</dd>
  <dt>tomatoes</dt>
  <dd>There’s no “e” in tomatoe.</dd>
</dl>

<p>Again, text is indented 4 spaces. (Put a blank line between each
term and  its definition to spread things out more.)</p>

<p>Here’s a “line block” (note how whitespace is honored):</p>

<table>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>Line one</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Line too</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Line tree</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<p>and images can be specified like so:</p>

<p>Inline math equation: $\omega = d\phi / dt$. Display
math should get its own line like so:</p>

\[I = \int \rho R^{2} dV\]

<p>And note that you can backslash-escape any punctuation characters
which you wish to be displayed literally, ex.: `foo`, *bar*, etc.</p>

Yet, for all that I have set down, we travelled much, always; but there were so many millions, and so few years.</p>

<p>Atticus said to Jem one day, “I’d rather you shot at tin cans in the backyard, but I know you’ll go after birds. Shoot all the blue jays you want, if you can hit ‘em, but remember it’s a sin to kill a mockingbird.” That was the only time I ever heard Atticus say it was a sin to do something, and I asked Miss Maudie about it. “Your father’s right,” she said. “Mockingbirds don’t do one thing except make music for us to enjoy. They don’t eat up people’s gardens, don’t nest in corn cribs, they don’t do one thing but sing their hearts out for us. That’s why it’s a sin to kill a mockingbird.</p>

<p>I took a deep breath and listened to the old brag of my heart. I am, I am, I am.</p>

<p>We believe that we can change the things around us in accordance with our desires—we believe it because otherwise we can see no favourable outcome. We do not think of the outcome which generally comes to pass and is also favourable: we do not succeed in changing things in accordance with our desires, but gradually our desires change. The situation that we hoped to change because it was intolerable becomes unimportant to us. We have failed to surmount the obstacle, as we were absolutely determined to do, but life has taken us round it, led us beyond it, and then if we turn round to gaze into the distance of the past, we can barely see it, so imperceptible has it become.</p>

<p>The most beautiful things in the world cannot be seen or touched, they are felt with the heart.</p>

<p>Hello babies. Welcome to Earth. It’s hot in the summer and cold in the winter. It’s round and wet and crowded. On the outside, babies, you’ve got a hundred years here. There’s only one rule that I know of, babies-“God damn it, you’ve got to be kind.</p>]]></content><author><name></name></author><summary type="html"><![CDATA[Truly it was a great journey, and in it I met with many, whom to know was to love; but whom never could I see again; for life has not space enough; and each must do his duty to the security and well-being of the Redoubt.

<p>“Ah! who? I would call your attention very particularly to two points. One is that the murdered man had an appointment with someone at the pool, and that the someone could not have been his son, for his son was away, and he did not know when he would return. The second is that the murdered man was heard to cry ‘Cooee!’ before he knew that his son had returned. Those are the crucial points upon which the case depends. And now let us talk about George Meredith, if you please, and we shall leave all minor matters until to-morrow.”</p>

<p>There was no rain, as Holmes had foretold, and the morning broke bright and cloudless. At nine o’clock Lestrade called for us with the carriage, and we set off for Hatherley Farm and the Boscombe Pool.</p>

<p>“There is serious news this morning,” Lestrade observed. “It is said that Mr. Turner, of the Hall, is so ill that his life is despaired of.”</p>

<p>“An elderly man, I presume?” said Holmes.</p>

<p>“About sixty; but his constitution has been shattered by his life abroad, and he has been in failing health for some time. This business has had a very bad effect upon him. He was an old friend of McCarthy’s, and, I may add, a great benefactor to him, for I have learned that he gave him Hatherley Farm rent free.”</p>

<p>“Indeed! That is interesting,” said Holmes.</p>

<p>“Oh, yes! In a hundred other ways he has helped him. Everybody about here speaks of his kindness to him.”</p>]]></content><author><name></name></author><summary type="html"><![CDATA[“But if he is innocent, who has done it?”]]></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde</title><link href="http://localhost:4000/blog/2016/jekyll/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde" /><published>2016-01-01T00:00:00+09:00</published><updated>2016-01-01T00:00:00+09:00</updated><id>http://localhost:4000/blog/2016/jekyll</id><content type="html" xml:base="http://localhost:4000/blog/2016/jekyll/"><![CDATA[<p>“My will? Yes, certainly, I know that,” said the doctor, a trifle sharply. “You have told me so.”</p>

<p>“Well, I tell you so again,” continued the lawyer. “I have been learning something of young Hyde.”</p>

<p>The large handsome face of Dr. Jekyll grew pale to the very lips, and there came a blackness about his eyes. “I do not care to hear more,” said he. “This is a matter I thought we had agreed to drop.”</p>

<p>“What I heard was abominable,” said Utterson.</p>

<p>“It can make no change. You do not understand my position,” returned the doctor, with a certain incoherency of manner. “I am painfully situated, Utterson; my position is a very strange–a very strange one. It is one of those affairs that cannot be mended by talking.”</p>

<p>“Jekyll,” said Utterson, “you know me: I am a man to be trusted. Make a clean breast of this in confidence; and I make no doubt I can get you out of it.”</p>

<p>“My good Utterson,” said the doctor, “this is very good of you, this is downright good of you, and I cannot find words to thank you in. I believe you fully; I would trust you before any man alive, ay, before myself, if I could make the choice; but indeed it isn’t what you fancy; it is not as bad as that; and just to put your good heart at rest, I will tell you one thing: the moment I choose, I can be rid of Mr. Hyde. I give you my hand upon that; and I thank you again and again; and I will just add one little word, Utterson, that I’m sure you’ll take in good part: this is a private matter, and I beg of you to let it sleep.”</p>

<p>Utterson reflected a little, looking in the fire.</p>]]></content><author><name></name></author><summary type="html"><![CDATA[“My will? Yes, certainly, I know that,” said the doctor, a trifle sharply. “You have told me so.”]]></summary></entry></feed>
