Yet, for all that I have set down, we travelled much, always; but there were so many millions, and so few years.</p>

<p>Atticus said to Jem one day, “I’d rather you shot at tin cans in the backyard, but I know you’ll go after birds. Shoot all the blue jays you want, if you can hit ‘em, but remember it’s a sin to kill a mockingbird.” That was the only time I ever heard Atticus say it was a sin to do something, and I asked Miss Maudie about it. “Your father’s right,” she said. “Mockingbirds don’t do one thing except make music for us to enjoy. They don’t eat up people’s gardens, don’t nest in corn cribs, they don’t do one thing but sing their hearts out for us. That’s why it’s a sin to kill a mockingbird.</p>

<p>I took a deep breath and listened to the old brag of my heart. I am, I am, I am.</p>

<p>We believe that we can change the things around us in accordance with our desires—we believe it because otherwise we can see no favourable outcome. We do not think of the outcome which generally comes to pass and is also favourable: we do not succeed in changing things in accordance with our desires, but gradually our desires change. The situation that we hoped to change because it was intolerable becomes unimportant to us. We have failed to surmount the obstacle, as we were absolutely determined to do, but life has taken us round it, led us beyond it, and then if we turn round to gaze into the distance of the past, we can barely see it, so imperceptible has it become.</p>

<p>The most beautiful things in the world cannot be seen or touched, they are felt with the heart.</p>

<p>Hello babies. Welcome to Earth. It’s hot in the summer and cold in the winter. It’s round and wet and crowded. On the outside, babies, you’ve got a hundred years here. There’s only one rule that I know of, babies-“God damn it, you’ve got to be kind.</p>]]></content><author><name></name></author><summary type="html"><![CDATA[Truly it was a great journey, and in it I met with many, whom to know was to love; but whom never could I see again; for life has not space enough; and each must do his duty to the security and well-being of the Redoubt.

<p>“Ah! who? I would call your attention very particularly to two points. One is that the murdered man had an appointment with someone at the pool, and that the someone could not have been his son, for his son was away, and he did not know when he would return. The second is that the murdered man was heard to cry ‘Cooee!’ before he knew that his son had returned. Those are the crucial points upon which the case depends. And now let us talk about George Meredith, if you please, and we shall leave all minor matters until to-morrow.”</p>

<p>There was no rain, as Holmes had foretold, and the morning broke bright and cloudless. At nine o’clock Lestrade called for us with the carriage, and we set off for Hatherley Farm and the Boscombe Pool.</p>

<p>“There is serious news this morning,” Lestrade observed. “It is said that Mr. Turner, of the Hall, is so ill that his life is despaired of.”</p>

<p>“An elderly man, I presume?” said Holmes.</p>

<p>“About sixty; but his constitution has been shattered by his life abroad, and he has been in failing health for some time. This business has had a very bad effect upon him. He was an old friend of McCarthy’s, and, I may add, a great benefactor to him, for I have learned that he gave him Hatherley Farm rent free.”</p>

<p>“Indeed! That is interesting,” said Holmes.</p>

<p>“Oh, yes! In a hundred other ways he has helped him. Everybody about here speaks of his kindness to him.”</p>]]></content><author><name></name></author><summary type="html"><![CDATA[“But if he is innocent, who has done it?”]]></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde</title><link href="http://localhost:4000/blog/2016/jekyll/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde" /><published>2016-01-01T00:00:00+09:00</published><updated>2016-01-01T00:00:00+09:00</updated><id>http://localhost:4000/blog/2016/jekyll</id><content type="html" xml:base="http://localhost:4000/blog/2016/jekyll/"><![CDATA[<p>“My will?

<p>“Well, I tell you so again,” continued the lawyer. “I have been learning something of young Hyde.”</p>

<p>The large handsome face of Dr. Jekyll grew pale to the very lips, and there came a blackness about his eyes. “I do not care to hear more,” said he. “This is a matter I thought we had agreed to drop.”</p>

<p>“What I heard was abominable,” said Utterson.</p>

<p>“It can make no change. You do not understand my position,” returned the doctor, with a certain incoherency of manner. “I am painfully situated, Utterson; my position is a very strange–a very strange one. It is one of those affairs that cannot be mended by talking.”</p>

<p>“Jekyll,” said Utterson, “you know me: I am a man to be trusted. Make a clean breast of this in confidence; and I make no doubt I can get you out of it.”</p>

<p>“My good Utterson,” said the doctor, “this is very good of you, this is downright good of you, and I cannot find words to thank you in. I believe you fully; I would trust you before any man alive, ay, before myself, if I could make the choice; but indeed it isn’t what you fancy; it is not as bad as that; and just to put your good heart at rest, I will tell you one thing: the moment I choose, I can be rid of Mr. Hyde. I give you my hand upon that; and I thank you again and again; and I will just add one little word, Utterson, that I’m sure you’ll take in good part: this is a private matter, and I beg of you to let it sleep.”</p>

<p>After 10+ years using WordPress I finally made the switch to GitHub Pages (confession: I still use WordPress for certain projects at work). My switch largely centered around this rant that played itself out quite frequently in my head:</p>

<p>When you want something simple, having a WordPress site often comes with a lot of other things: a web hosting plan, updating plugins, monitoring auto-updates so your site’s template and functionality don’t break, a MySQL database, dealing with being a target for hackers, a lot of clicking around and fussing with settings, hacking Thesis, and on and on. <!-- flesh the previous sentence out with links --> For a personal website that features just few pages, a CV, and maybe a place to write blog posts and link to your social media accounts and departmental web pages – or just experiment around with the awesomeness of HTML5 <!-- flesh this out with links to codepen stuff or --> and the amazing things you can do with client side scripting <!-- ahem, more links -->, WordPress is bloated.</p>

<p>Do I really need to make a database call to serve an About page with less than 500 words on it? No. Do I want a bunch of third-party scripts from whatever plugin author(s) just to have social sharing tools? No. Do I want to have to hack PHP in an existing WordPress template to adjust the banner for my logo or to just simplify the user experience? No. I still want to be able to get up and running in less than five minutes, but can’t it be a little lighter?</p>

<p>So I made a wishlist of the things I wanted for a personal website:</p>

<ul>
  <li>simplicity</li>
  <li>good performance and reliability</li>
  <li>no databases</li>
  <li>hosting to be free or really cheap</li>
  <li>a custom domain</li>
  <li>the ability to work on my site from anywhere if needed</li>
  <li>to use open source tools supported by an active development community</li>
  <li>to get up and running quickly</li>
  <li>to have version control on my website, preferably Git</li>
  <li>to be able to share my code so others can easily re-use it</li>
</ul>

<p><a href="http://staticgen.com/">There are a lot of lightweight CMS options out there</a>, but I fell for the GitHub + Jekyll toolchain. It’s well known and now pretty established, and the partnership it has developed with Jekyll developers (it’s based in Ruby) and its use of Markdown to separate content from markup just seemed to click with me as a digital publisher. It may not be for everybody, but after an afternoon playing around with and getting over the learning curve, I think it can be for a lot more than developers.</p>

<p>That’s why after building my site from scratch (along with the help of Bootstrap), I’ve finally taken it a step further and created a <a href="/guides/github-pages/" title="Creating and Hosting a Personal Site on GitHub">beginner’s guide to getting started building and hosting a personal website and blog with GitHub Pages and Jekyll</a>. It is very step-by-step. The goal is to make GitHub and Jekyll more accessible to a wider audience interested in an alternative to WordPress. It even refactors code to teach you how Jekyll templates work. And I should note, it was created to accompany a workshop I gave during <a href="http://ttc.iss.lsa.umich.edu/ttc/enriching-scholarship/">University of Michigan’s 2014 Enriching Scholarship Conference</a>.</p>]]></content><author><name></name></author><summary type="html"><![CDATA[This is an overdue note about my switch to using GitHub and Jekyll for this website.]]></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">The New Academic Librarian</title><link href="http://localhost:4000/blog/2014/the-new-academic-librarian/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="The New Academic Librarian" /><published>2014-01-23T00:00:00+09:00</published><updated>2014-01-23T00:00:00+09:00</updated><id>http://localhost:4000/blog/2014/the-new-academic-librarian</id><content type="html" xml:base="http://localhost:4000/blog/2014/the-new-academic-librarian/"><![CDATA[<p>After what seemed to be a never-ending publication process, the book <a href="http://www.amazon.com/The-New-Academic-Librarian-Responsibilities/dp/0786471530"><em>The New Academic Librarian: Essays on Changing Roles and Responsibilities</em></a> – edited by Wayne State University librarian <a href="http://www.rebecapeacock.com/">Rebeca Peacock</a> and the library’s associate director for marketing, Jill Wurm – is finally published and available. After skimming through the table of contents, this will no doubt be a valuable and necessary read for library and information science students interested in careers at an academic library; the essays featured in the volume present a very current inside look at the functions and responsibilities of academic librarians, especially in regards to how they interact with, use, play with, and rely on technology in their work.</p>

<p>I’m selfishly excited about this new book because I was fortunate enough to contribute a chapter about my experiences and reflections as a digital projects librarian. In addition to reflecting on what I’ve learned, I looked at over 80 job descriptions for “digital projects librarians” (or variantions of that title) and found the job descriptions matched my own hunches and experiences; the digital projects librarian is very much an amalgam of the traditional librarian and the fast moving, ever changing world of web development. Here’s the abstract to my chapter, “Looking Under the Hood: A View of the Digital Projects Librarian in the Academic Library”:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Despite the fact that digital libraries have been with the library profession for the last two decades, relatively little has been written about digital projects librarianship from a professional standpoint. Digitization of text and images, the creation of SGML and XML encoded texts, digital preservation, networked information, and large scale database searching have been with the library profession since the early 1990s. Less than an emerging role, it is more accurate to describe digital projects librarianship as an evolving role in the academic library. Over the last 20 years, this role has expanded to encompass a wide range of skills and responsibilities from web design and development to copyright and project management. Successful digital projects librarians are interested and unafraid to look underneath the hood of the web to see what powers it and makes things happen. As such, digital projects librarians should be experienced and versed in the traditional skill sets of their predecessors, while at the same time excited to adapt and learn new technologies by drawing from a very deep and wide pool of skills in the professional web design and web development communities. In addition, as academic libraries and institutions continue to embrace digital technologies to provide relevant services for faculty, students, and staff, the roles and projects of a digital projects librarian continue to expand well beyond digitization to involve library instruction, digital publishing, software and application development, user interface design, digital preservation, and data curation. To help you form a complete picture, this chapter will discuss a range of digital projects job descriptions, digital projects at academic libraries, the components underpinning many library digital collections, and also provide resources to help the reader build their digital project skill set and to illustrate emerging trends for this exciting and evolving form of librarianship.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Congratulations to Rebeca and Jill and all the contributing authors to this much needed understanding of academic librarianship in the 21st century!</p>]]></content><author><name></name></author><category term="default" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[After what seemed to be a never-ending publication process, the book The New Academic Librarian: Essays on Changing Roles and Responsibilities – edited by Wayne State University librarian Rebeca Peacock and the library’s associate director for marketing, Jill Wurm – is finally published and available.

Everyday on the web we see things that are beautifully made by our peers – work that spark ideas for new projects or teaches us a new technique or technology.

<p>Enter <a href="http://jmcglone.com/swatches"><em>Swatches</em></a>, a simple way to track sets of hex color values and also give attribution to those designers or sources that help me better understand color and how colors work together in design.

<p>In getting here, I’ve been heavily influenced by <a href="http://dribbble.com">dribbble’s</a> design approach to color sets, as well as the attention it gives to color in the designs its users post and share in that space. But I’d like to be able to track sets of colors I find that work really well, as well as the hex color values that make up those sets.</p>

<p>In the future, I’d like to develop a way to make this much more dynamic or work better with Jekyll but also a tool or service that others can utilize. In the meantime, I hope this is useful to people and inspires others to think more about color and using color on the web.</p>]]></content><author><name></name></author><summary type="html"><![CDATA[Designers find inspiration and motivation from other designers.
