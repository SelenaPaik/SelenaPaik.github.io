  <h1 class="section-title">Building Your Online Academic Identity</h1>
  <p>Today I gave a workshop as a part of <a href="http://www.lsa.umich.edu/humanities/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">University of Michiganâ€™s Institute for the Humanities</a> Publishing Practice Series aimed at faculty and graduate students looking to build-up their online identity. Thereâ€™s already been great work done by the writers at <a href="http://chronicle.com/blogs/profhacker/creating-and-maintaining-a-professional-presence-online-a-roundup-and-reflection/43030" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">ProfHacker</a> on this topic, insightful tips over at <a href="http://www.educause.edu/ero/article/intentional-web-presence-10-seo-strategies-every-academic-needs-know" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">EDUCAUSE</a>, and an article published in <a href="http://firstmonday.org/ojs/index.php/fm/article/view/3969/3292" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>First Monday</em></a> studying and classifying the types of online academic personas folks are starting to create for themselves. This workshop tried to bring all of that together and emphasize that building your online persona is really just SEO for your name.</p>

<p>Since the previous folks were kind enough to share their thoughts with the world, Iâ€™ve kept that spirit and made my notes available â€“ you can check them out at <a href="http://goo.gl/Hn3Cc9" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">http://goo.gl/Hn3Cc9</a>.</p>
