Hi, I am [Selena](https://selenapaik.github.io){:target="_blank"}.
I am a first year M.S. student in Computer and Information Technology at [Purdue University](https://www.purdue.edu){:target="_blank"} advised by [Professor Sudip Vhaduri](https://sudipvhaduri.wordpress.com){:target="_blank"}. 

My research interests : `deep learning`, `computer vision`, `affective computing`, `healthcare infomatics`, `biometric authentication`

I am deeply interested in human emotion & biometric data analysis and deep learning. I like to develop tools that help machines easily understand and analyze human emotions and biometric information to create new values. I employ a variety of methodologies and frameworks in my research, drawing on computer vision and deep learning.

I studied computer science and engineering at [Ewha Womans University](https://www.ewha.ac.kr/ewhaen/index.do){:target="_blank"}
